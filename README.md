# ARC-JGS2

Corpus-level ARC orientation workbench inspired by JGS2.

The goal is to treat ARC-1 tasks as many small logical worlds that can be oriented
end to end at once:

```text
raw grids
-> object parse
-> canonical object frames
-> relation/witness signatures
-> shared primitive hypotheses
-> per-task orientation table
```

This is not yet a magic ARC solver. It is the scaffold where a solver can learn
which local edits overshoot: transformations that look good for one object or
one train pair but break cross-example consistency, symmetry, counting, or role
bindings.

## Quick Start

Run the included demo tasks:

```bash
cd /home/ath/arc-jgs2
python3 -m arc_jgs2 orient --demo --out runs/demo
```

Run on an ARC-AGI / ARC-1 dataset directory:

```bash
python3 -m arc_jgs2 orient --data /path/to/ARC-AGI/data/training --out runs/training
python3 -m arc_jgs2 orient --data /path/to/ARC-AGI/data/evaluation --out runs/evaluation
```

Outputs:

- `orientation.jsonl`: one full orientation record per task.
- `orientation.csv`: compact corpus table.
- `summary.json`: primitive-family and quality counts.
- `index.html`: visual dashboard.

Run the conservative primitive solver:

```bash
python3 -m arc_jgs2 solve --data data/ARC-AGI/data/training --out runs/training-solutions
```

The solver only predicts when one primitive explains every train pair. Everything
else abstains, which keeps local overshoot visible instead of hiding it behind a
bad guess.

## Current Primitive Families

- exact-copy
- global color-map
- crop / bounding-box extraction
- geometric transform over whole grid
- output canvas resize
- object-count and component-shape signatures
- witness signatures for symmetry, palette change, size change, and object deltas

## JGS2 Translation

| JGS2 simulation | ARC-JGS2 |
| --- | --- |
| local sub-problem | object, region, color role, relation |
| local solve update | proposed edit or transformation |
| global energy | consistency over train pairs and test executable plan |
| overshoot | local rule fits a piece but breaks task-wide structure |
| co-rotated subspace | canonical object frame under translation/orientation/color role |
| cubature samples | small diagnostic witnesses for global consistency |
| damping Hessian | penalty/confidence term for locally plausible but globally disruptive edits |

The next step is to add an iterative hypothesis engine that accepts, dampens, or
rejects primitive perturbations using the witness fields emitted here.
